## Quickstart

Clone the repository and run `npm install`. The prerequisites in the [React Native Getting Started](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.23/docs/getting-started.html#content) guide should be met for both iOS and Android. Then run the following commands to start the emulators:

```
$ react-native run-ios
$ react-native run-android
```

To enable the React Native Debugger tab in Google Chrome, use the shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> in the iOS emulator and <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> in the Android emulator to bring up the hardware menus and enable remote JS debugging.
